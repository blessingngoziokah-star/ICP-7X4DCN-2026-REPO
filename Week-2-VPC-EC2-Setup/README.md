# Compute & Networking Project: VPC & EC2 Setup

   Objective
This project focused on *AWS networking and compute services*
The task involved Launching a Linux EC2 instance in a custom VPC, and securely connect to it using SSH.


## Tools Used
- AWS VPC – Custom network setup and isolation  
- AWS EC2 (Linux) – Virtual server deployment  
- Security Groups – Firewall configuration  
- SSH – Secure remote server access  


## Why These Tools
- VPC was used to control networking and improve security.
- EC2 provided a scalable compute environment.
- Security Groups enforced strict access (SSH only).
- SSH enabled secure server management.


## Key Challenges & Learnings
- Understanding how VPC components work together  
- Fixing SSH access issues caused by firewall rules  
- Applying the principle of least privilege in security  

## What I Learned
- How to design and use a custom VPC instead of the default network  
- How EC2 instances operate within a VPC  
- How to configure Security Groups as a firewall using the principle of least privilege  
- Hands-on experience with Linux server access via SSH
- How small networking misconfigurations can affect connectivity and how to troubleshoot them

## Outcome
Successfully deployed and accessed a Linux server in a custom VPC, gaining practical experience in *cloud networking, security, and infrastructure setup*.
